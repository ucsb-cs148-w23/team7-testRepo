Description of me:

I'm a third year cs student and I've taken 156 before so I'm familiar with the agile work methodology. I primarily know c++ and python and very unfaimilar with frontend frameworks. 

For our project I think that we should use a google oauth and allow only people with the @ucsb.edu use the product. 

How do we gather the information for what classes the user are in?

- Do we create a survey and allow the user to input the classes and times?
- We should scrape the available times for the library and rooms available
