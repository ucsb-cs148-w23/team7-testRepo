My name is Jonah Park
Third Year CS Major from Orange County, California
I am 5'8

Ideas for project:
Create a web app that allows users to create study "events"
Events are found by class and/or section
Events will include time, place, a description of the purpose (study for final, work on study guide, etc.)
