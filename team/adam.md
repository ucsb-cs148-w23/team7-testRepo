Adam Pedersen:

I am a 3rd year CS major. I have experience in React/Javascript and backends from cs156 and my internship.

I think the project would be best as a web app. We can adopt mobile further on down the line by making the web app
mobile compatible.
I think its a good idea for us to divide up tasks during a sprint and then each work on the tickets individually, rather
than pair programming, etc.
