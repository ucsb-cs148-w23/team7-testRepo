My name is Philip, I am a third year computer science major.

Some ideas I have for the project are making a schedule interface similar to google calendar or when2meet that allows
users to enter their availability, which then matches them with people with similar availabilities. There could also
be options for general study groups or course specific study groups, which users can select when looking for study
groups. Perhaps there can also be a "friends" section for people a user frequently studies with, too.
